Just how fast can you solve **1 million sodokus?** How close can you get to the computer to know what's going on inside to speed up how fast it runs? How much fat can you chop off. What is truely necessary.

I downloaded [1 Million Sodoku Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanpark/sudoku), and the goal is to solve them all as fast as possible. This will be a journey into cpp, and understanding more about how computers actually work. I've split the sodoku states and solutions into two seperate files.

Some of the constraints / limits I'll set. 
1. Timing of the challenge starts with file reading, and ends when a file with the solution has been written
2. No precomputation of solutions - general heuristics and optimisations are allowed, but no specific solutions to individual problems

The goal is for learning as well as optimising. As such, blog posts, and consistant journalling / notes of what you learned are expected. Write whenever you are confused, before and what is confusing you and the understanding psot. also write when your speculations don't line up with reality.

The rest is up to you!
